#Takes 3 variables as input, in the following order:
#1. name of the TMO reactivity file
#2. name of the DMS reactivity file
#3. name of the output file
#If the two profiles don't have the same number of nucleotides, the script will fail.

#Typically you don't need to edit the profile files output from shapemapper as long as you aligned to the same sequence for TMO and DMS.

# example input: python identify_Tsites.py *TMO profile name* *DMS profile name* *Name of output file*
